I would like to create a basic streamo add-on that allows a user to connect to their tracked account and then provides a stream option that points to the specific API endpoint that allows you add to a list then we could choose if they have a lot of lists we could provide a stream link for each one depending on what they have so they would need to authenticate. Then we would need to be able to pass this information through AURL parameter so we're not storing anything
